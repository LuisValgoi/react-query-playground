# Description

This repository was created following [this link here](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview) & [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzLmQn19kS4&ab_channel=LeighHalliday).

Its main goal is to combine the `query` w/ `mutation` from `react-query` w/ additional of a `grid-system` from `@emotion`.

# Stack

- `CRA Template`: for bootstrap.

- `lodash`: for helpers.

- `@emotion/styled`: for styling.

- `grid system`: for structuring css.

- `react-query`: for caching, fetch and update data.
